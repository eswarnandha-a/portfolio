# EmailJS Error Debugging Guide

## Current Issue
You're receiving emails correctly, but still getting the error message "Something went wrong. Please try again or email me directly at eswaranand1999@gmail.com"

## Most Likely Causes

### 1. Auto-Reply Template Issue (Most Common)
The error is probably happening in the **second EmailJS call** (auto-reply to the user).

**Check your auto-reply template `template_qxzxnu7`:**
- Does this template exist in your EmailJS dashboard?
- Does it have the correct variables: `{{to_name}}`, `{{to_email}}`, `{{reply_message}}`?
- Is it configured to send TO the user's email address?

### 2. EmailJS Service Limits
- You might be hitting rate limits (too many emails in a short time)
- Check your EmailJS dashboard for usage limits

### 3. Template Configuration Issues
- The auto-reply template might have incorrect "To Email" configuration
- It should be set to `{{to_email}}` to send to the user

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Use the Debug Component
1. Temporarily add the `EmailJSDebug` component to your app
2. Test each email separately to see which one fails
3. Check the browser console for detailed error messages

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
When you submit the form, open browser DevTools (F12) and look at the Console tab for:
- ✅ "Main email sent successfully" - means the first email worked
- ⚠️ "Auto-reply failed" - means the second email failed
- ❌ "Main email failed" - means the first email failed

### Step 3: Test Auto-Reply Template
In your EmailJS dashboard:
1. Go to Email Templates
2. Find `template_qxzxnu7`
3. Use the "Test" feature
4. Make sure it works with sample data

## Quick Fixes

### Option 1: Fix the Auto-Reply Template
Make sure your `template_qxzxnu7` template looks like this:

**Subject:** `Thank you for contacting me, {{to_name}}!`

**Body:**
```
Hello {{to_name}},

{{reply_message}}

Best regards,
Eswar Anand
```

**To Email:** `{{to_email}}`

### Option 2: Use the Simple Version (Temporary Fix)
If you can't fix the auto-reply quickly, replace your current form with `GlassFormSimple`:

```jsx
// In your main component, replace:
import GlassForm from './components/GlassForm';
// With:
import GlassForm from './components/GlassFormSimple';
```

This version only sends the main email (no auto-reply) and should work perfectly.

### Option 3: Disable Auto-Reply Temporarily
In your current `GlassForm.jsx`, you can comment out the auto-reply section:

```jsx
// Comment out lines 48-63 (the auto-reply part)
// The form will only send the main email
```

## Expected Console Output (When Working)
```
Sending email with params: {from_name: "John Doe", from_email: "john@example.com", ...}
✅ Main email sent successfully: {status: 200, text: "OK"}
✅ Email process completed successfully
```

## Expected Console Output (When Auto-Reply Fails)
```
Sending email with params: {from_name: "John Doe", from_email: "john@example.com", ...}
✅ Main email sent successfully: {status: 200, text: "OK"}
⚠️ Auto-reply failed (but main email was sent): {status: 400, text: "Bad Request"}
✅ Email process completed successfully
```

## Next Steps
1. Try the debug component first to identify exactly which step fails
2. Check your EmailJS dashboard for the auto-reply template
3. If needed, use the simple version as a temporary solution
4. Once you identify the issue, we can fix the specific problem

The good news is that your main email functionality is working perfectly! This is just about the auto-reply feature.
