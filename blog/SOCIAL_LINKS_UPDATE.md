# Social Links Update - Footer Navigation

## ✅ What I've Updated

### 1. **Footer Social Icons** (App.jsx)
I've converted all your social media icons from static `<div>` elements to clickable `<a>` links:

#### **LinkedIn** (31.png)
- **URL**: `https://in.linkedin.com/in/eswar-anand13`
- **Target**: Opens in new tab
- **Alt Text**: "LinkedIn"

#### **GitHub** (32.png)  
- **URL**: `https://github.com/eswarnandha-a`
- **Target**: Opens in new tab
- **Alt Text**: "GitHub"

#### **Instagram** (33.png)
- **URL**: `https://www.instagram.com/eswaranand_/`
- **Target**: Opens in new tab  
- **Alt Text**: "Instagram"

#### **Resume** (34.png + Resume Button)
- **URL**: `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fRZithJMrjCdi0fbbvswZq7F1YGwzb_O?usp=drive_link`
- **Target**: Opens in new tab
- **Alt Text**: "Resume"

### 2. **CSS Improvements** (glassmorphism.css)
- ✅ Added `text-decoration: none` to remove link underlines
- ✅ Added `:focus` styles for keyboard accessibility
- ✅ Added `:active` styles for better user feedback
- ✅ Maintained all existing hover effects and animations

### 3. **Security & Best Practices**
- ✅ All links use `target="_blank"` to open in new tabs
- ✅ Added `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security
- ✅ Proper semantic HTML with meaningful alt texts
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Before**: 
- Social icons were just decorative images
- Clicking them did nothing
- Resume button had a placeholder link

### **After**:
- ✅ **LinkedIn icon** → Opens your LinkedIn profile
- ✅ **GitHub icon** → Opens your GitHub profile  
- ✅ **Instagram icon** → Opens your Instagram profile
- ✅ **Resume icon** → Opens your Google Drive resume folder
- ✅ **Resume button** → Also opens your Google Drive resume folder

## 🔧 Testing Your Links

### **Quick Test Checklist**:
1. **LinkedIn**: Should open `https://in.linkedin.com/in/eswar-anand13`
2. **GitHub**: Should open `https://github.com/eswarnandha-a`
3. **Instagram**: Should open `https://www.instagram.com/eswaranand_/`
4. **Resume**: Should open your Google Drive folder

### **Visual Feedback**:
- ✅ Icons still have hover animations (glow, scale, move up)
- ✅ Icons have focus outlines for keyboard users
- ✅ Icons have active states when clicked
- ✅ All styling preserved from original design

## 🚀 What to Do Next

1. **Test the links**: Click each social icon to verify they work
2. **Check mobile**: Test on mobile devices to ensure touch targets work
3. **Update resume link**: If you want to link to a specific resume file instead of the folder, let me know

## 📝 Notes

- **Instagram URL**: I used `@eswaranand_` from your description
- **Resume**: Currently links to your Google Drive folder - you can change this to a direct PDF link if preferred
- **All links open in new tabs** so users don't leave your portfolio
- **Icons maintain their original styling** and animations

## 🔄 If You Need Changes

If any of the social icons are mapped to the wrong platforms (e.g., if 31.png is actually GitHub instead of LinkedIn), just let me know and I can swap the URLs around!
